# Netguru - Recruitment task

Recruitment task from my point of view.

## Usage

### Installing
Clone this project and use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install the required node-modules:
```bash
npm install
```
### Running development server
To start the live preview of the development version use:
```bash
gulp serve
```
### Build a production version
Build the production version with a single command:
```bash
gulp build
```
When the build finishes, your files will be available in the **dist** folder.

## My decisions
### BEM & SCSS
It's one of the best connections I know! Writing styles for the BEM methodology is easier to manage as the codebase grows than no-standard.
### Gulp.js
It helps me to automate some processes like SCSS compilation, CSS and Javascript minification, automatic CSS prefixes.

### Code
1. **Custom Font** - I imported only the **AvertaStd Regular** and **AvertaStd Bold** versions, because there was no other types (like italic, or semi-bold) in the [Xd project](https://xd.adobe.com/spec/f9a4086e-290c-4e2f-6e97-8f5446c5d829-8f95/).
2. **Plain text module** - text field contains two additional sentences that are not visible in the [Xd preview](https://xd.adobe.com/spec/f9a4086e-290c-4e2f-6e97-8f5446c5d829-8f95/). I didn't show them either:
``[...] Thanks to rich widgets, Flutter apps look and feel great. You can create your own custom app design or use ready UI elements following specific platformsâ€™ guidelines.``

3. **Plain text module** - I created this section for maximum re-usability, therefore the number is dynamically generated by [CSS counter](https://developer.mozilla.org/pl/docs/Web/Guide/Liczniki_CSS).
