                <p>Python’s syntax is clear and elegant, and the programming language is object-oriented. Still, Python is considered as a <strong>high-level and general-purpose</strong> programming language used not only for enhanced web development but also <a href="https://flaviocopes.com/sample-app-ideas/">simple web applications</a>.</p>

                <p>The simplicity of Python means that not only is it easy to maintain, but it can also handle quick growth. What’s more, if you use the <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django framework</a> – the most popular framework for Python – you will also put yourself in good stead to scale. This is because the components that make up Django are decoupled (i.e. independent from one another), which means that they can be chopped, changed, removed, and replaced as and <strong>when your project requires larger or more specific solutions.</strong></p>
